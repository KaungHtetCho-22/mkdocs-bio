# Biodiversity

Welcome to the **Biodiversity Project Documentation**.  
This guide provides detailed instructions, references, and technical explanations for setting up the hardware, training AI models, and running inference pipelines. 
It is organized for everystep to follow consistently from setup to deployment.

All the source code are pushed to the github.
